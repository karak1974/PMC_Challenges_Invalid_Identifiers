## Short description of your proposal

Many European companies struggle to keep up with GDPR regulations. Users are annoyed by cookie consent dialogs. We want to help both parties by
a solution that is similar to client-side certificates, but the user experience is much easier using the Sporran browser extension.

## Technical details

Sporran has a hierarchical deterministic wallet capable of storing multiple personas. These personas might get credentials from attesters, but
we did not focus on that aspect in this hackaton. What we achieved though is that each website gets to see a different DID from the same browser,
so we are not building yet another facebook like button that BigTech uses to correlate visits of the user on different websites.
