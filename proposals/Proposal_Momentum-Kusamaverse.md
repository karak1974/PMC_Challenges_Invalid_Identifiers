## Short description of your proposal

When a user opens the website the Polkadot.js and Guest option always come up even when we have an extension installed and want to use it.  

The UI/UX can be confusing and this can cause bad experience for many users, thus they won't use the platform for long.  
Islands and their system make confused users especially for new ones.  

## Technical details

In our opinion Kusamavere's login panel would be more efficient if it can detect specific wallets like Polkadot.js for Polkadot and Sporran for KILT. It detects the wallet and offer to log in with it, if the user disagree to log in with any wallet then log in as guest automatically.

UI/UX is too detailed for a new user who visits the Metaverse. For them it would be much more friendly if the UI wouldn't put this many widgets on the screen. For example a new user don't want to see the Miro button on the left side during a meeting because they won't use it unless called by the host to do so. There should be a light UI mode only for the essential things.

The island system is confusing and not only for newcomers. We've seen people with experience too in Kusamaverse can't find the island what they're looking for. The island system should be more like a hallway than a multi layer ring.
